        <p>
            My talent as a web developer is to learn new coding languages and to build a webpage. 
            A web developer's experience can be both bad and good. For my experience, I would say that learning new coding languages is fun and challenging at the same time. Through the experience of being a web developer, I learned how to be well organized. Additionally, I learned that you have to think about people who has disabilities when creating a webpage.

                <li>Madeline Ray- I have never been a good designer and always struggled to find a good web developer. I came across M. Khan Web Specialist online and decided to give him a shot. I am happy to say that I am the proud owner of a website that I created with M. Khan Web Specialist. I paid a small fee and had a website that I could use to advertise my business. M. Khan Web Specialist is a great resource for beginner web developers and designers who need help with a website.</li>
