        <p>
            My talent as a web developer is to learn new coding languages and to build a webpage. 
            A web developer's experience can be both bad and good. For my experience, I would say that learning new coding languages is fun and challenging at the same time. Through the experience of being a web developer, I learned how to be well organized. Additionally, I learned that you have to think about people who has disabilities when creating a webpage.
